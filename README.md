## Ben Noonan

I am former business consultant and teacher who has decided to pursue a career change by learning to code at Makers Academy, one of Europeâ€™s most selective and demanding coding bootcamps.

I am looking for a junior developer role in the London area that will allow to continue my progression and pursue my passion for creating high quality software.


## Skills

#### Technological skills

During my times as an accountant and business consultant, I specialized in analysing where clients could benefit from implementing new IT systems and software to increase efficiency and reduce labour costs.  This ranged from small tweaks to their software usage,  to total overhauls of their IT systems.  For example, over the course of one audit, I transformed a small client from storing paper files in a shed to being fully cloud based, and equipped with the latest accountancy software.  Our analysis showed that this would reduce their admin costs by over 25% year on year, as well giving staff members far more time to concentrate on more productive areas of the business.

#### Analytical skills

My finance background has ensured I have a keen eye for detail.  I have found that my experience of auditing has been particularly invaluable when it comes to debugging code, as I have a lot of practice in identifying errors or areas of weakness that initially seem buried in large quantities of data or documents.  It also taught me to establish the simplest, most readable way to present this analysis to clients.

#### Communication skills

Prior to my time in business consultancy I spent nine months in Shanghai working as a teacher.  This forced me to develop the ability communicate ideas clearly and concisely.  Helping to prepare students for exams also helped to develop my organizational skills.  I also helped to implement improvements to the curriculum used by my company, identifying areas where students struggled most and fine-tuning the classes in these areas to break the problems down into smaller, more manageable chunks, which saw student pass rates increase substantially.  I was offered a management role for this achievement.
